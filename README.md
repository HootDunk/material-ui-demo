# material-ui-demo
A quick tutorial series that I followed to get up to speed on Material-UI, published by the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KEpWHtG10M&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58).   This tutorial is super well done and covers a lot of content including: various MUI components, the makeStyles hook generator (with plain object, mixins, and passed props for conditional rendering), the theme provider for editing the default theme, using className vs classes to add/edit component styles,  etc..

He also introduced json-server, an NPM package that allows you to quickly create a mock-rest api so that you front-end can make api calls.  I've needed something like this so many times!  I'd like to see this used for a course teaching front-end.  You could build out the mock-api and give UI mock ups and have the student's build out the app.  This way they get to work with a REST api making asynchronous calls without the pains of needing to find a good, free api.  

Up next I want to return to MUI to keep practicing and expanding on the concepts explained in the series.
